This is the first app I worked on in iOS App Development. I learned how to use xcode and swift. I was able to use swift UI to create a list screen that allows users to track things they have to do. I learned basic UI framework through building this app. The items in the list are able to be added, deleted, and moved around. This allowed me to learn more swift and aid me in my future projects.
